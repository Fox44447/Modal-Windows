# Modal-Windows

Repo in JS created to store the Modal Windows code with minor descriptive lines

We can observe here that the funtions + loop + CSS classes + if statements + variables are mixed and act together interchangeably to produce a really nice UX.

Also, in this code there is a built in addEventListener, for Escape key, across the document, but only in the specific situation. More precisely only when the modal window is open.

There is potential to basically apply this feature in vast major of the web development projects ✅ 👍🏻
